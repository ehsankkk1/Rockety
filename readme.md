# Three.js Journey

Our Three.js Rocket project is an innovative and interactive experience that focuses on the integration of physics repository. The project aims to simulate the realistic physics of a rocket's launch and flight, utilizing the powerful physics engine built into the Three.js library.

The project features a detailed 3D model of a rocket, complete with realistic textures and lighting effects. The rocket is fully interactive, allowing users to control the thrust and angle of the rocket, as well as its trajectory. The physics engine calculates the rocket's movement based on the user's input, providing a realistic and accurate representation of the rocket's flight.

One of the key features of this project is its integration with a physics repository, which provides real-world data on the physical properties of a rocket. This includes information on the rocket's thrust, weight, and aerodynamics, allowing for a highly accurate simulation of the rocket's flight.

In addition to the interactive rocket simulation, the project also includes educational content on the physics of rocket flight, providing users with a deeper understanding of the science behind the simulation.

Overall, our Three.js Rocket project is a unique and engaging experience that combines the power of Three.js with the realism of physics repository, providing users with an interactive and educational exploration of rocket physics.
